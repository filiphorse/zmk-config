Task: Reformat this ZMK keymap for consistent readability without changing semantics.

Formatting rules:


1. Do not modify behavior, labels, keycodes, or structure.

2. Keep each row of bindings on a single line.

3. Insert one blank line between each row within a layer.

4. For every layer:
	- Rows 1–3 must have 10 keys each (aligned in columns).

	- Row 4 must have exactly 6 keys, visually centered using leading spaces only (no trailing padding).

	- Row 5 must have exactly 4 keys, visually centered using leading spaces only (no trailing padding).

	- It’s OK for Row 4 and 5 to include &none entries, but only up to 6 and 4 total respectively. Do not pad them out to 10.


5. Maintain consistent spacing so columns line up across rows 1–3 in each layer.

6. Do not introduce or remove keys except to replace excess items in rows 4–5 with &none if absolutely required to meet the 6/4 counts (but prefer preserving existing keys).

7. Keep comments and includes intact.

Now reformat the following ZMK keymap accordingly, returning only the updated DTS with no extra commentary:
